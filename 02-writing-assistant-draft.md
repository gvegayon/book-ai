George:

> Now, let's write the chapter "AI as a writing assistant". This chapter is part of a book that I am writing, where I am collecting examples, experiences, and reflections about AI and its usage in science. Generally, I want you to avoid generating new ideas (unless I ask you explicitly to do so), and I need you to help me organize my own ideas. I will provide some bullets about the chapter, and I would like you to rewrite it in a more discursive way so that it reads fluently. I also need you to keep the difficulty to a more general level, so folks don't need to be computer scientists to understand the text. Don't do anything yet!

ChatGPT:

> Understood 👍
> 
> I won’t generate new ideas or start drafting yet.
> 
> When you’re ready, please share your bullet points for the chapter “AI as a > writing assistant.” I will then:
> 
> Rewrite them into a fluent, discursive narrative
> 
> Keep the language accessible to a general scientific audience
> 
> Focus strictly on organizing and clarifying your ideas (no added concepts > unless you explicitly ask for them)
> 
> Go ahead and send the bullets whenever you’re ready.

George:

> Here are the main pointers of the chapter; again, avoid being creative and stick to what I am writing here:
> 
> ## Creating original text
> 
> - One of the biggest uses of AI is for writing. For better or worse, AI text is now everywhere (even this chapter). Now, what makes the difference is how much AI influenced the writing. Is it that the AI wrote the entire thing based on something like "write me a chapter about writing with AI", or did the AI solely organize your ideas (like I tried here)?
>
> - LLMs are built to create text. Now, the quality of the text is something else. While the grammar of AI has improved significantly, the truthfulness of what it creates still faces some issues. Because of that, it is paramount for the user to always review what the AI wrote for you.
>
> - Personally, I think it is completely OK to use AI for writing ANYTHING. Now, for this to be ethical, the user needs to ensure that the core contents, the principal ideas, and whatnot are of your authorship. Furthermore, indicating what the role of AI in your writing is is also very important.  The thing is, how do we ensure that that's the case, I mean, that the AI is not generating new ideas on your behalf?
>
> - Believe it or not, the solution is very simple: you just ask the AI to avoid creating new ideas. In my experience, for every text generation that I have use AI for, I always ask it to simply organize my ideas and that usually works. Furthermore, before making the ask, I will generally start the chat of the AI in a way to provide context and end the prompt with a message such as "Don't do anything just yet." (like I do here!).
>
> - Again, the pitfall comes when the user is reduced to a short prompt. Moreover, I would argue that those are the easiest cases to detect. Some clear signals that an AI wrote text without much supervision or a vague prompt: (a) the texts tend to be very long (AI will try to "integrate" across fields of knowledge, so it usually errs on the side of verbosity), (b) if it is not discursive, it is awfully bullet, (c) the use of emojis and other complex characters, and (d) the overly polite/correct tone. When you put guardrails on what the AI can write or cannot, those symptoms are missing.

> ## Reviewing text
> 
> - Another good usage of AI is for text review. For grammar, my preference is using Grammarly. This company (which is based in Ukraine), provides a very cool AI assistant for writing that can be integrated into your desktop and mobile. Whether you are a native English speaker or ESL, I assure you you can learn from the app. One notable example was when I was talking about this with my PhD committee chair, Dr Paul Marjoram. Paul, who was born and raised in the UK, had fantastic writing, yet when he passed a brief text to Grammarly, the AI was able to improve his writing (he was very impressed with it).
> 
> - Context is always key. In the case of Grammarly, you can specify what type of audience and goal your text has. For Chat GPT, this would be again in the form of natural language, that is, be explicit about what you are trying to do. For example, "the following text is oriented for a scientific journal in the field of social networks. You are an expert in exponential-family random graph models. etc.".
> 
> - When it comes to reviewing whole texts, there are a couple of approaches you can follow. In my case, I tend to go by paragraphs or sections (if it is a longer text). This way, you are in control of what may be possible edits an AI can do for you. In the case of things like grants, it could well be that you may want the AI to score your grant (I've done that), in which case it is good to pass it all the information (the full grant, Biosketches, and even the funding opportunity call). The example with grant was exceptional. I was preparing an NIH R21 grant (which is currently under review), and before jumping into using AI for writing or reviewing, I asked three colleagues to go over it and privide me some comments. After getting their feedback, I tried asking ChatGPT the same information, but providing context about the call, and telling it to acquire the role of an NIH panel; I also asked it to be more objective (less nice) during the review. The results, the points the AI highlighted as weeknesses and strenghts were THE SAME my three colleagues identified idependently.
> 
> - This is a superb way to use LLMs. Summarizing information. This, sometimes overlooked,  application can be a great way to see if the AI understands what you are writing. Asking the AI to privide you with a brief summary of what it is reviewing is something I would say is necessary. This also applies to programming (as we will see later). You can achieve this by, once again, being literal: "before you go on, please provide a summary of the text I am asking you to review", for example.

> - Bottom line, using AI for creating texts is something I recommend, as long as it is helping you organize your thoughts and not doing it entirely for you. Furthermore, with the right contextual information, AI can be a great tool for reviewing your text.
